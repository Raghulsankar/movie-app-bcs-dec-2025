1. Hooks - useState
2. useContext
3. useEffect
4. etc

> every Hooks has different syntax because each states are functions

<!-- formula -->

> const[like,setLike] = useState(initial value)

> setState is an Update state.

> why Routing?

different different componenets difffernt pages move

# Advantages of routing (when we have routing)

- easy to access
- loading is high
- organised
- sharing url
- secure route

# disadvantages

[React router website](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation)

- npm i react-router
- import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";
- <BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter> insise main.jsx file

# graph history check using vscode

- git checkout main

# types of router

# hash router

# browser router

> hash router supports all browser including old browser like IE

> browser router not support IE router lie old browser only support new browser

# useNavigate

+1 => one page forward
-1 => one page bacward

# home
